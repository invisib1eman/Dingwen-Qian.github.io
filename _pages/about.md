I am a postdoctoral researcher in the McKetta Departmenet of Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, working with Prof. Thomas Truskett. I received my PhD degree in Applied Physics at Northwestern University, under the supervision of Prof. Monica Olvera de la Cruz.

I am a soft matter theorist with broad interest in self assembly, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and chemical physics.

Currently, I work with problems in the field of soft matter physics related to three main topics : 

- Complex nucleation theory in reticular chemistry

- Transport in charged systems, including polyelectrolyte gel and charged colloidal suspensions

- Chemical and physical properties of membranes
  
- Optical response of disordered systems, e.g., plasmonic colloidal gels. 

For some more information about me, please see my [CV](http://invisib1eman.github.io/Dingwen-Qian.github.io/files/CV_Dingwen_Qian.pdf).
