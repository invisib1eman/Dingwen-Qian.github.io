I am a PhD student in the Department of Applied Physics at Northwestern University. 

I am a soft matter theorist with broad interest in self assembly, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and chemical physics.

Currently, I work with problems in the field of soft matter physics related to three main topics : 

Complex nucleation theory in reticular chemistry

Transport in charged systems, including polyelectrolyte gel and charged colloidal suspensions

Chemical and physical properties of membranes

For some more information about me, please see my CV.
